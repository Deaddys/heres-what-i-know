The Read Me

The people who I first started playing with are all involved. Brooke, AJ, Tahoe, Jonny, and company. That Ego is egoist. And Atsuko. There are cookies that I accidentally hand out to yall just by being on any internet. If I download chrome, edge, brave, or opera I simply have to go to chrome(orwhatever)://sync-internals to see all the shit that gives you. Horrifying. 

That you all are literally the dumbest smart people I've ever come across.
