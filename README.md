The Read Me

sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing and I forgot what I've been researching for hours and then suddenly look up and see the most random shit I've ever seen ... but then I also see one of the names. 

I know it's been a nuisance, trying to figure out if the certain pairings actually could go together if if that is actually a good direction ... but I must be doing something right because I'm not some con. a blue schemed theme staring  your your $400+ tickets

hm. i wonder if its close by or online.... 

and im not kidding. i said what? a week ago times up? tooktwo years and how many people?

but what do I know I'm just a web dev.
